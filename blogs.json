    "message": "It's no news that regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It strengthens your muscles and bones, improves cardiovascular health, reduces stress, boosts memory and promotes better sleep, among other things. \r\n\r\nHowever, as exasperating as it might be to hear, simply sweating it out in the gym isn't enough. In order to reap all the health benefits of exercise, it's important that you do it right. \r\n\r\nHere, top fitness experts share the most common workout mistakes that might be sabotaging your fitness goals — and how you can fix them:\r\n\r\nSkipping warm-up. \"Think of your muscles and connective tissue like a rubber band.  If you pull a rubber band when it’s cold it can snap. But if you heat up that rubber, it’s far more elastic and flexible,\" says Jillian Michaels, wellness coach, entrepreneur and TV personality.\r\n\r\nNot having a game plan. Typically, \"starting a workout without a set plan for that particular day can lead to a lot of wasted time,\" notes Stokes. This is why it's crucial to set your intention — which includes listening to your body in order to make the most of the time you have. Moreover, \"not setting aside time for a workout and assuming you’ll just 'fit it in' at some point in the day accounts for many missed workouts. So, put it in your planner, just like you would a doctor's appointment,\" adds the fitness instructor.",

    "title": "How to find the best fruits?",
    "message": "The ritual of shopping for fruit is a quintessential part of every grocery run. As you venture into the produce section, you are met with a vast spectrum of options. Neatly organized rows of apples, towering stacks of watermelons in hefty corrugated cardboard boxes, and the radiant range of citrus fruits are just a fraction of what's on offer. This vibrant tableau, however, has its complexities. Consider the humble apple with varieties lined up in a row can differ tremendously in taste and texture, with the ripeness of each fruit adding yet another layer of variability.\r\nNavigating this fruitful labyrinth requires a well-formulated strategy. The key to this challenge lies in understanding how to discern the perfectly ripe and ready-to-eat fruits from those underripe or overripe. Mastering this skill can be the difference between a disappointing culinary experience and the joy of savoring a piece of fruit at the peak of its flavor. \r\nInitially, you may feel like a novice navigating through a puzzling maze, but in no time, you'll be traversing the produce aisle with the ease and precision of a seasoned botanist. Each grocery run will morph into a rewarding expedition as you confidently select the crème de la crème of the crop, consistently bringing home fruit at its flavorful zenith and ready to be relished.\r\n\r\nRead More: https://www.tastingtable.com/1357151/simple-tricks-pick-best-fresh-fruit/",

I had to go back and forth, learn more modules, practice and use chat GPT...\r\n\r\nI build first the design of the page, but then adding functionality was so challenging for me and I found I dont have enough knowledge for this yet, so I stopped, learned more about APIs and started to build the website again focusing more on functionality and only after that I added back the design. \r\n\r\nIt was a long and hard journey, but still I feel that I rely a lot on chat GPT, rather then finding the solution by myself. Also I dont have enough time to practice regularly, it is only couple of hours on weekend... wish I can have more time",
